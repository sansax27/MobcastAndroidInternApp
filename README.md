# MobcastAndroidInternApp


Mobcast Innovations is SaaS based company that serves clients with huge name both in terms of revenue as well as Brand. They serve huge Banks in India like PNB, SBI and many others; many big companies like Sanofi, OYO etc. Their Core product is Employee Communications And Training Software - Android, iOS and Web App.This repository is made signify my work as part of Android Team Of Mobcast Innovations Ltd. Company. The repository of this work is bound by NDA and thereby private. It contains my major works which are expected from my responsibilities such as : - 

A) To create a whole new version of the old app which has all the modern aspects including UI and technologies which is mainly intended for International Audience.

B) To work on client projects.

My role in both of these is not limited to any specific domain like UI. I do all lot of work
that is involved in making a product not limited by anyway be it creating UI, refactoring
code, adding modern things etc.

As for the live work which can been seen, the features added in V4 of the Core product of this app would be live soon. But as to estimate my work, take a look at already existing V3 app on PlayStore - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.mobcast.core&hl=en_IN&gl=US. Majority the features of this version and some additional features have been implemented by me in V4. V4 App is going to have a modern and international feel, in terms of everything be it UI, Code Architecture, Kotlin, better performance etc. Old V3 app was in java and was using obselete technologies, conversion of which was required to meet the standards now. I did that part. Apart from that, as it's a SaaS based company, I have also worked on projects of companies like BPCL, Oyo etc. Overall, it is an immersive experience to contribute to many projects at once.
